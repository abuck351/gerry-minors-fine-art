		<h3>Early Life</h3><br>
		<img src="gerryminor.jpg">
		<p>On August 12, 1929 Geraldine Mae Cassem was born in the farming community of Mitchell, South Dakota.  While this was a joyous occasion for her parents, Randall and Maria Cassem, the troubling times of the Great Depression were soon to follow.  Further complicating their lives, the Great Dust Bowl made farming impossible, and her father struggled to provide financially.  When she was five years old, Geraldine and her family emigrated to the small community of Whittier, California to live with her maternal grandparents.</p>
		<p>Geraldine was raised in a family where creativity was valued and encouraged.  Her father was a talented musician and artist, and he provided Geraldine and her sister with lessons in both areas.  Her mother called on her two girls to help with household chores and, as a result, both daughters learned the art of cooking and sewing.</p>
		<p>In her free time, Geraldine usually sought a pencil and paper for drawing.  Her parents recognized and fostered her love for art and throughout the years, she secretly hoped to become an artist.  Because she enjoyed drawing people, Geraldine was most interested in someday painting portraits.  During high school she wanted to pursue art as a possible career, until her parents counseled her to make a more practical choice such as nursing, teaching, or secretarial work.  Art, they suggested, would be better kept for a hobby during retirement.  As a result, Geraldine broadened her course selections to include both art and business skills classes.</p><br>

		<h3>Later Years</h3><br>
		<p>While enrolled at Fullerton College, her life took a dramatic turn.  Gerry (as she was fondly referred to) met and married Benton Minor, a returning WW2 Navy veteran who was continuing his education on the GI Bill.  Armed with her Quaker upbringing, optimistic outlook on life and an education, Gerry believed their future looked promising.  She set aside her own college aspirations and began working as a secretary on the UCLA campus in order to support her husband as he worked toward his degree and teaching credential.  To some, it may have appeared as though she cast aside her dream of a career in art.  However, to this new wife, it was only a delay. </p>
		<p>Six children later, the hope of becoming an artist was lost in the "shuffle of life."  There weren't enough hours in the day to care for her family and to continue drawing.  In 1970, following the death of her third born child, Lynda Lee, Gerry needed something to pull her through this great loss.  God works for good in all things, and this promise became evident.  She wanted to rekindle her dream of painting portraits, and she began by painting Lynda.  God brought healing to her and the rest of her family through this creative process.  Family was her career choice, and painting became her hobby and reward.</p>
		<p>Gerry Minor began studying oil painting with Marge Yaros in her Anaheim studio.  Her subject matter is varied, with an emphasis on portraits, and she often chooses people who have touched her life in a meaningful way.  Over the years Geraldine has received commissions and has participated in local art exhibits sponsored by community art associations within Orange County, California.</p>
